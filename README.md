## Introduction 

Hi i'm Shuaib, a person who was completely new to coding before meeting with code institute a few months ago. My **goal is to become the best version of myself in anything that I do which includes programming**. I have an engineering background and have been studying engineering ever since I was seventeen. That's eight years of studying engineering, in that time I have managed to get a few diplomas in engineering and also a degree in Mechanical engineering however, I never actually thought to myslef "what is my plan", to be honest I was just following the failed system of education this country has. A question comes up "why am i looking to change field or industry"? the answer to that is because i have a dream of one day working for a top technology company like Apple, Google or Oracle etc and the world is heading in a direction of technology. My goal is to complete this course to the best of my ability and then find my first junior developer role and then build an empire of skills and experience within me to get into a big tech company. My plan is also to stay with code instiute to further my knowlege in app development.    

## UX

This is my first ever website and I thought "what a good idea it would be to create my first website as an online portfolio". So this is a webpage that will showcase my skills, my education and my projects to future employers. This website will be updated regularly and improved always depending on the skill level that i'm at. 


## Technologies and Deployment
I basically used **everything** that was taught in the videos and nothing more. The following is what technologies were used and also will dicuss how i impletemnted them on making my very first webpage. 

* **HTML & CSS:** I used these languages for the syling of my website. 
* **JavaScript & BootStrap:** The navigation menu and the hover effects on the project was completed with the help of BootStrap.     JavaScript wasn't used directly, what i mean by this is that the JavaScript i used came directly from me copying BootStrap  and not me coding with JavaScript.

* **GitHub:** This is used to store my code in a safe place. The method is simple and easy. 
    1. **git add . or gitt add (file name)** depending on what you want to send. 
    2. **git commit -m "intial code"** (for example), within the speech marks i normally type what i needed to do and what i have completed to that point.
    3. **git push** is to send the files into the repository which is stored in the safe place on **GitHub**
    4. **git status** is to identify what changes have been made.
    
* **Gitpod:** This is the platform i was intoduced to by Code Institue to code

* **Balsamiq:** This gave me a good idea of how i wanted my webpage to look. 

## Summary Points of Project 

After reviewing myself below are some key points of my success in completing the project, i feel the main two points were keeping thing simple by copying and pasting within my document and consitency within the document.  

* I created the basic sturcture within the HTML document by using **!TAB**. I then copied the **CDN links** from BootStrap and created link tags within the head of the document and pasted in the appropriate place.

* I had a meeting with my mentor and we dicussed the layout of my document. I started with the **NAVBAR** and used BootStrap to help me with this.I wanted a scroling webpage because it will be easy to use. I then broke my HTML document into four sections which are my headings **About, Skills, Projects,** and **Contacts**.

* From watching a few youtube videos i got an idea of what an online porfolio should look like and started my About me section. I decided to create **class=card** and start styling it with what would look good. I kept the **card** class consistent througout the other sections which made it eaiser because i just copied and pasted. 

* Each section had a **ID class** of its section name, first reason was so it would be easy to read and second was of course to syle the ID wthin the CSS document. I kept this consistent as well. 

* Lastly I completed a footer which i got help with from BootStrap.

## Testing 

* There are three methods i used to thest my webpage.
1.**People:**
2.**Computer/Laptop:**
3.**Phones/iPad:**
