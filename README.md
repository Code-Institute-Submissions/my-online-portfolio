# User Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project 1 -Online Portfolio

## Introduction 

Hi i'm Shuaib, a person who has massive goals and will always be a student and is very hardworking. I have an engineering background and have been studying engineering ever since i was 17 and now i'm 25. That's 8 years of studying engineering, in that time i have manged to get a diploma level 2 and 3 in engineering and also a degree in Mechanical engineering. A question comes up why am i looking to change field or industry? the answer to that is my passion to code. My goal is to complete this course to the best of my ability and then find my first junior devloper role and then build to get into a big tech company. My plan is also to stay with code instiute to further my knowlege in app developmet.    

## UX

This is my first website and i thought "what a good idea it would be to create my first website as an online portfolio". So this is a webpage that will showcase my skills, my education and my projects. This website will be updated regularly and improved always alongside depending on the skill level that i'm at.
