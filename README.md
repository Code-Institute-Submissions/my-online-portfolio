# User Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project 1 (Personal Portfolio)

## Introduction 

Hi i'm Shuaib, a person who ahs big goals and will always be a student and is very hardworking. I have an engineering background and have been studying engineering ever since i was 17 and now i'm 25. That's 8 years of studying engineering, in that time i have manged to get a diploma level 2 and 3 in engineering and also a degree in Mechanical engineering where i then hoped to get into a big engineering company however, this did not happen so i turned to coding because i know programming has a massive future. Anyway I decided to create a online porfolio for myself to showcase my skills, projects and education to future employers. My goal is to complete this course to the best of my ability and then find my first junior devloper role and then build to get into a big tech company. My plan is also to stay with code insttiute to further my knowlege in app developmet.
