# User Centric Front-End Development Milestone Project 1 -Online Portfolio

## Introduction 

Hi i'm Shuaib, a person who was completely new to coding before meeting with code institute. I has massive goals and will always be a student and is very hardworking. I have an engineering background and have been studying engineering ever since i was 17 and now i'm 25. That's 8 years of studying engineering, in that time i have manged to get a diploma level 2 and 3 in engineering and also a degree in Mechanical engineering. A question comes up "why am i looking to change field or industry"? the answer to that is because i see where the world is going and it's technology. My goal is to complete this course to the best of my ability and then find my first junior developer role and then build to get into a big tech company like Google for example. My plan is also to stay with code instiute to further my knowlege in app developmet.    

## UX

This is my first ever website and i thought "what a good idea it would be to create my first website as an online portfolio". So this is a webpage that will showcase my skills, my education and my projects to future employers. This website will be updated regularly and improved always depending on the skill level that i'm at. 

## Features 

## Technologies 
I basically used **everything** that i was taught in the videos and nothing more. The following is what technologies i used and also will dicuss how i impletemnted them on making my very first webpage. 

* **HTML & CSS:** I used these langusges for the syling of my website.
* **JavaScript & BootStrap:** The navigation menu and the hover effects on the project was completed with the help of BootStrap.     JavaScript wasn't used directly, what i mean by this is that the JavaScript i used came directly from BootStrap helping me with the code and not me coding with JavaScript.

* **GitHub:** This is used to store my code in a safe place. The method is simple and easy. 
    1. **git add . or gitt add (file name)** depending on what you want to send. 
    2. **git commit -m "intial code"** (for example), within the speech marks i normally type what i needed to do and what i have completed to that point.
    3. **git push** is to send the files into the repository which is stored in the safe place on **GitHub**
    4. **git status** is to identify what changes have been made.
